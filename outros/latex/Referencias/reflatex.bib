Web 2.0 is the network as platform, spanning all connected devices; Web 2.0 applications are those that make the most of the intrinsic advantages of that platform: delivering software as a continually-updated service that gets better the more people use it, consuming and remixing data from multiple sources, including individual users, while providing their own data and services in a form that allows remixing by others, creating network effects through an "architecture of participation," and going beyond the page metaphor of Web 1.0 to deliver rich user experiences.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Purpose:  The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of different types of content of viral marketing in a popular social networking site. Our research is founded on recent studies which categorize posts on Facebook.  Design/methodology/approach:  Data for 2583 posts in eight profiles of Brazilian beer brands were coded and analyzed. We used a regression model and Analysis of Variance to establish relationships among independent variables and a dependent variable.  Findings:  Two hypotheses were supported. There was a positive relationship between posts of the categories Fan and Promotion and Publicity and viral marketing. Posts of the categories Information and Pool did not have any significant effects, and confirmed previous studies which analyzed likes and comments as dependent variables.  Originality/value:  Previous studies using the platform did not categorize posts created by brand fans/followers. Our typology is a quantitative improvement in relation to studies with similar objectives. Hence, marketers involved with brand management on Facebook should publish posts which promote the brand and reproduce content generated by people engaged with it if they seek to increase the viralization capacity of such posts.},

However, the success of this kind of practice depends on a range of factors including what we explore and refer to in the present research as the individual's "viral dynamics". We thus propose a causal model in which viral dynamics is determined by the individual's social capital and prior attitudes. Based on a survey of young adults, the authors test the effects of structural and relational capital as well as attitudes on viral dynamics. The results evidence that the individual's connectedness in the email network does not impact viral dynamics, whereas the individual's integration and relationship with the network and the attitudes towards viral messages prove critical to the individual involved in the receiving-forwarding process. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Cooke2008,
	abstract = {Market Research is often accused of failing to provide the insights sought by our clients, and in an increasingly complex society we are challenged to embrace a different model of thinking with different principles at its centre. We believe that a Web 2.0 research platform and a social network approach offers marketing research new tools to meet the challenges of the future. The paper identifies a number of trends that may well provide fertile ground for marketing researchers to develop new approaches. The open source movement will not only affect the way that we think but the very methodologies that we use. The emergence of Web 2.0 offers us an array of collaborative tools with which to develop new research approaches to explore the rapidly changing social and media environment. At the same, the rapid growth of online social networks has fuelled the already rich research literature on the importance of studying humankind in 'tribes' or 'groups'. We argue that the combination of social computing tools and an understanding of social networks will allow us to build new types of research communities, in which respondents interact not only with the researchers but with the clients and most fertilely with each other. Moreover as we examine these types of networks we will become increasingly better able to handle multiple sources of data, and be as comfortable with these new forms of user generated content as we are with the traditional data collection tools of the last fifty years. We believe that these social software tools and trends provide the blueprint for researchers to build new types of 'participatory panels' or 'research communities' and we describe our experiences in developing such a community.

As the Internet is becoming more and more popular, it is starting to make a big impact on people's day-to- day life. As a result of this revolutionary transformation towards the modern technology, social networking on the World Wide Web has become an integral part of a large number of people's lives. Social networks are websites which allow users to communicate, share knowledge about similar interests, discuss favorite topics, review and rate products/services, etc. These websites have become a powerful source in shaping public opinion on virtually every aspect of commerce. Marketers are challenged with identifying influential individuals in social networks and connecting with them in ways that encourage viral marketing content movement and there has been little empirical research study about of this website to diffuse of viral marketing content. In this article, we explore the role of social network websites which has influence on viral marketing, and the characteristics of the most influential users to spread share viral content. Structural equation modeling is used to examine the patterns of inter-correlations among the constructions and to empirically test the hypotheses.},

@article{Trusov2009,
	abstract = {The authors study the effect of word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing on member growth at an Internet social networking site and compare it with traditional marketing vehicles. Because social network sites record the electronic invitations from existing members, outbound WOM can be precisely tracked. Along with traditional marketing, WOM can then be linked to the number of new members subsequently joining the site (sign-ups). Because of the endogeneity among WOM, new sign-ups, and traditional marketing activity, the authors employ a vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling approach. Estimates from the VAR model show that WOM referrals have substantially longer carryover effects than traditional marketing actions and produce substantially higher response elasticities. Based on revenue from advertising impressions served to a new member, the monetary value of a WOM referral can be calculated; this yields an upper-bound estimate for the financial incentives the firm might offer to stimulate WOM.},

Think of user-generated content platforms, open source software, crowdsourcing, and knowledge markets - just a few examples of ways that large numbers of loosely networked users are invited to create or evaluate products, content or ideas. This is the social web, the interlinked virtual universe that to so many executives seems to offer the irresistible promise of providing something - ideas, work, decisions - for (almost) nothing, if only they could manage it right. But the first step toward smart management of the social web is to understand something paradoxical about it: The new platforms may be all about harnessing crowds and communities, but in the end, those crowds and communities are nothing but a sum of individuals. And your company's social web efforts will succeed only to the extent that you are able to attract good individuals, motivate them to perform good work, and empower them to get to know and trust one another enough to collaborate toward the end goals of the community. The question is, How do you do that? The answer: By capitalizing on the motivational power of reputation.},
